## Documentation

### [ServerParameters](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/v1.46.0/keepalive/keepalive.go#L50)

```go
type ServerParameters struct {
	// MaxConnectionIdle is a duration for the amount of time after which an
	// idle connection would be closed by sending a GoAway. Idleness duration is
	// defined since the most recent time the number of outstanding RPCs became
	// zero or the connection establishment.
	MaxConnectionIdle time.Duration // The current default value is infinity.
	// MaxConnectionAge is a duration for the maximum amount of time a
	// connection may exist before it will be closed by sending a GoAway. A
	// random jitter of +/-10% will be added to MaxConnectionAge to spread out
	// connection storms.
	MaxConnectionAge time.Duration // The current default value is infinity.
	// MaxConnectionAgeGrace is an additive period after MaxConnectionAge after
	// which the connection will be forcibly closed.
	MaxConnectionAgeGrace time.Duration // The current default value is infinity.
	// After a duration of this time if the server doesn't see any activity it
	// pings the client to see if the transport is still alive.
	// If set below 1s, a minimum value of 1s will be used instead.
	Time time.Duration // The current default value is 2 hours.
	// After having pinged for keepalive check, the server waits for a duration
	// of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is
	// closed.
	Timeout time.Duration // The current default value is 20 seconds.
}
```

### [EnforcementPolicy](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/v1.46.0/keepalive/keepalive.go#L77)

```go
type EnforcementPolicy struct {
	// MinTime is the minimum amount of time a client should wait before sending
	// a keepalive ping.
	MinTime time.Duration // The current default value is 5 minutes.
	// If true, server allows keepalive pings even when there are no active
	// streams(RPCs). If false, and client sends ping when there are no active
	// streams, server will send GOAWAY and close the connection.
	PermitWithoutStream bool // false by default.
}
```

서버 측에서 keepalive 정책을 설정하는 데 사용된다. 서버는 이 정책을 위반하는 클라이언트와의 연결을 close 한다.

### [ClientParameters](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/v1.46.0/keepalive/keepalive.go#L33)

```go
type ClientParameters struct {
	// After a duration of this time if the client doesn't see any activity it
	// pings the server to see if the transport is still alive.
	// If set below 10s, a minimum value of 10s will be used instead.
	Time time.Duration // The current default value is infinity.
	// After having pinged for keepalive check, the client waits for a duration
	// of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is
	// closed.
	Timeout time.Duration // The current default value is 20 seconds.
	// If true, client sends keepalive pings even with no active RPCs. If false,
	// when there are no active RPCs, Time and Timeout will be ignored and no
	// keepalive pings will be sent.
	PermitWithoutStream bool // false by default.
}
```

연결이 끊겼을 때 능동적으로 상태 확인이 가능. 서버와의 연결이 활성화 되어있는 지 확인하기 위해 주기적으로 ping을 보내 확인한다.

## Examples

```go
var kaep = keepalive.EnforcementPolicy{
	MinTime:             5 * time.Second, // If a client pings more than once every 5 seconds, terminate the connection
	PermitWithoutStream: true,            // Allow pings even when there are no active streams
}

var kasp = keepalive.ServerParameters{
	MaxConnectionIdle:     15 * time.Second, // If a client is idle for 15 seconds, send a GOAWAY
	MaxConnectionAge:      30 * time.Second, // If any connection is alive for more than 30 seconds, send a GOAWAY
	MaxConnectionAgeGrace: 5 * time.Second,  // Allow 5 seconds for pending RPCs to complete before forcibly closing connections
	Time:                  5 * time.Second,  // Ping the client if it is idle for 5 seconds to ensure the connection is still active
	Timeout:               1 * time.Second,  // Wait 1 second for the ping ack before assuming the connection is dead
}

s := grpc.NewServer(grpc.KeepaliveEnforcementPolicy(kaep), grpc.KeepaliveParams(kasp))
```
